# Notes from 2024-04-29
## Plain text
- Whenever possible represent information in the form of plain text.
- Plain text makes it easier to search through it, look for changes by calculating diff and verify it's authenticity using checksum.
- Plain text does not mean unstructured information. XML, HTML, JOSN all are forms of plain text.

## Shell Games
- Think of your command shell as a woodworker's crafting table. Just as his work revolves around that table your work revolves around a command shell
,so get familiar with it.
- Play around in your shell
- Make the shell your own - set color themes, configure a prompt (not sure what this is will need to look into this),
setup aliases for most used commands, automate everthing you can.
