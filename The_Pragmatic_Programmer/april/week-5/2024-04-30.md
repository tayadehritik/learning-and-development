# Notes from 2024-04-30
## Power Editing
- You need to get familiar with your editor, learn basic shortcuts.
- Turned off auto-repeat as suggested by the book.
- Get fluent in your editor. I have chosen Intelli J as android studio is based on it.
- Everytime you find yourself repeating something try to think of a better and easier way to do it.
- Book says to use extension or create your own if you don't find something for your particular use case.
