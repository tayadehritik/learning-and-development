# Notes from 2024-04-26
## Prototyping and Post-it notes
- Prototypes don't really need to be in the form of code. They could be a collection of post-it notes or diagrams on a whiteboard etc.
- Prototype code is supposed to be destroyed. Prototyping code is not useful, it is the learnings that are made through protoyping that are useful.
- Communicate clearly with the parties involved what a prototype is. They might want you to go ahead with the prototype as a final product.
## Domain Specific Languages
- Two Types - internal domain languages and external languages.
- Internal domain languages are eventually compiled into their host language.
- External language code is converted into a data structure that could be parsed with any language or it's own specific language.
