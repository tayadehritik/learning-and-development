## Estimating
- I always had a problem when my friends would pitch their ideas to me and ask how long something like this would take to make
and I could never tell them a good estimate and if I do give them a timeline, I would struggle to justify it.
- This topic explained a good way to solve this problem, short answer is when someone asks you for an estimate, tell them "I'll get back to you"
- The ideal estimate should be made in increments along with the development. With each increment, you make changes to the estimate and let the other party know about the changes in the estimate.
- After you are done with the project, check how far were you from the estimate and note how you can avoid it in the future.
