# Notes from 2024-05-16
## Inheritance Tax
- Book suggests that using Inheritance introduces coupling and our eventual goal should as less coupling as possible.
- There are better ways to do things that Inheritance offers.
    1. Interfaces and protocols
    2. Delegation
    3. Mixins and traits
## 1. Interfaces and protocols (same thing)
- I have always wondered why would someone use interfaces and what use case could it fulfill. This topic has given me an answer to that question.
- Think of interfaces as an alternative to inheritance.
- Interfaces create less coupling by writing less code at the interface declaration level and giving more agency to the class that implements the interface to decide how it wants to implement it.
- We can use interfaces as types as well, think of this hierarchy.
