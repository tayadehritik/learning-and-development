# Transforming Programming
- Don't think of your programs as data structures or just representing some state. Think of them as an assembly line where we feed raw data from one end and finished product(information) comes out the other end.
- The first step to finding transformations is looking at the requirements, find the most basic input and the last output you'll program will have. This way you can represent your whole program as just one function.
- Then define steps that'll lead your program from input to output.
- Think of pipeline operator in UNIX systems, how they send data from one program to another.
- Pass state around don't hoard it.
- Never pass raw values between transformations, wrap it some data structure which tells us that contained value is valid or not. This helps in error checking.
- Your code is supposed to become cleaner through this approach and overall design flatter.
- I will need to revisit this topic in the future as this contradicts the "keep your code decoupled" idea. I think I might have missed something here.
