# Notes from 2024-05-01
## Version Control
- Use version control for everything. You should be able to recover a tea spilled laptop just from the version control itself.
- Use branches - I have used github for a long time now but never felt the need to use branches because only I work on these projects,
but the book puts some good points on to why should I use them. For ex. When you are developing a new feature you could do that in isolation by creating a branch,
you could maybe create prototypes on a branch idk seems like a good way to organize code but not sure if it's good for a one person project.
- Will be using branches on this repo to organize notes and will merge branches every end of the week, revising the stuff learned.
- You should use version control for non-project stuff as well.
