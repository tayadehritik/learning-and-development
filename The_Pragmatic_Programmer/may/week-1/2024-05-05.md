# Notes from 2024-05-05
# Dead program tell no lies
- You should always read the damn error message.
- Let the program crash early, that way there won't be consequences further down the line because of an error.
- Crashing is the best thing you can do, but your environment should be able to restart itself after a crash.
- A dead program normally does less damage than a crippled one.
