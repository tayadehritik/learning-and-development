# Notes from 2024-05-03
## Text Manipulation
- Learn a language that could manipulate simple text related tasks
- With that language it should not take a lot of time to do these tasks.
- I am already familiar with Python to do such tasks. Will focus on using Python for more of such tasks.
## Engineering Daybooks
- You can keep a daybook to note down what you did, what you learned, ideas basically anything to do with your work.
- You can use it for meetings or jot down variable values while debugging.
- It is more reliable than memory.
- Try to use paper for this.
