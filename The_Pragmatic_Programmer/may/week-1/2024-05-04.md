# Notes from 2024-05-04
## Design by contract
- Your software modules should have a contract that states what they'll accept, give in return and what will happen if parties involved violate the contract
- A contract should state these values
  - Preconditions : What must be true in order for the routine to be called. It is caller's responsibility to pass good data.
  - Postconditions : What routine is guaranteed to do. The routine should conclude it cannot be an infinite task.
  - Class invariants : I didn't understand this part.
- Be strict with what the routine will accept and promise as little as possible in return.
