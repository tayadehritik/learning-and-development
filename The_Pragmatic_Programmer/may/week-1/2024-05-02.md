# Notes from 2024-05-02
## Debugging
- You should be comfortable while debugging, pressure or deadlines will distract you from debugging
- Tune out your ego and do not panic.
- Work with a code that is built cleanly without warnings.
- We want a bug that could be reproduced with a single command. Isolate the bug as much as possible.
- Read the damn error message before moving on too quickly.
- Use a debugger whenever possible
- Use binary chop when trying to isolate a problem. Let's say you are looking at a large stack trace, to find the revlevant error
go to middle of the trace check if error exists there. If it exists there then you know you have to up, If it does not then you know you have to go down.
- Same could be done with dataset inputs or releases that are causing issues.
- Try rubber ducking.
- Don't make assumptions - Prove it, fix your misunderstanding.
