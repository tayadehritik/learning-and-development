# Notes from 2024-05-08
## Don't outrun your headlights
- When you are driving at night you make decisions based on what is visible through your headlights and not beyond and those headlights have a certain range.
- Similarly, in software development you should make decisions based on feedback from small steps you take in creating your software and not look beyond, far in the future.
- Always take small deliberate steps, checking for feedback and adjusting before proceeding.
- Never take on a step or task that's "too big".
- You can never predict the future so write your code in a way that is replaceable.
