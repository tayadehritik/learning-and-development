### How to deal with events
1. Finite State Machines
   - Contains a set of states, one of which is current state. For each state we list events that are significant to that state. 
   - You transition from one state to another state through events.
   - If any other event other than events significant for that state occurs it is considered as error.
   - You can represent these states and events in a data structure.

2. The Observer Pattern
    - In observer pattern we have source of events called observable and a list of client called observers, who are interested in those events.
    - Like setOnClickListener() is an example of observer pattern in android.

3. Reactive Programming
   - Streams are involved in reactive programming, where events are treated as if they were collections of data.
   - Frameworks like React and Jetpack Compose follow reactive programming pattern.
   - We can perform normal collection operations on these streams as well.
   - Streams of events are asynchronous collections.
