## How to balance resources
- Function or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating that resource.
- If a routine needs more than one resource, then follow these two suggestions.
  1. Deallocate resources in opposite order to which you allocated them.
  2. When allocating same set of resources in different parts of the program, always allocate them in the same order to avoid deadlock conditions.
- Approach to balancing should be followed whenever you are using a finite resource.
- You can use finally block when an exception occurs before you get to deallocate a resource. You deallocate the resource in finally block.
