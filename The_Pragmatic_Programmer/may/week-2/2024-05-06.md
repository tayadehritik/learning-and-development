## Assertive Programming
### Assert
- An assert statement in a program usually accepts a boolean value and throws an assertion exception when that value is false.
```kotlin
assert(true)
```
- We need to use assertions in those situations where we think a scenario could never occur. We check this scenario using assertions.
- Don't use assertions in place of real error handling. They should only check for things that should never happen.
- Your assertion code should not have side effects. It should not change behavior of the system being debugged.
- Leave assertions turned on even in production.
