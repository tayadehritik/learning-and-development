# Learning and development
Purpose of this repository is to document my learnings and make myself familiar with the markdown syntax that will be used to take notes here.
## How the repository is structured
Each of the sub-directories represent a resource that was used for learning new stuff. Each resource is further divided into month -> week -> date. Each date will have a markdown file associated with it, which will contain notes from the day and if required code samples.
