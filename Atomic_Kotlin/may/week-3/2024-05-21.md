## Tail Recursion Example
```kotlin
tailrec fun factorial(num:Int,accum:Int):Int{
    val newAccum = num * accum
    if(num <= 1) return newAccum
    return factorial(num-1, newAccum)
}

@Test
fun testFactorial() {
    val result = factorial(5, 1)
    assertEquals(120, result)
}
```
- In this example you can see in factorial at the end there's only the call itself and no operation is being done on the call.
- This function is turned into an iterative solution at the end so try to think of it as such.
- When we write factorial in recursive way we go 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 and result is 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 24 -> 120
- But in this approach the result is only returned once 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 and result is -> 120 with each call we are sending the accumulated value like 5 -> 20 -> 60 -> 120 and at 1 we return this accumulated value.
- Will add another example of fibonacci
