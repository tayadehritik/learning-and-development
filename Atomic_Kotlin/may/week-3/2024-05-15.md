## Notes from 2024-05-15
### Local functions
- You can define functions inside functions in kotlin called as local functions.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    fun somethingElse() {
        println("here")
    }
    somethingElse()
}
```
### Anonymous functions
- You can define local functions without giving them names called as anonymous functions.
- Think of them as lambdas, but they use fun keyword.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val abc = fun(): String{
        return "here"
    }
    println(abc())
}
```
### Labels
- A "return" expression only works in the context of function defined using "fun" keyword.
- To return from a lambda you need to give it a label -> called as a labeled return.
- "tag" here is the label, so return@tag returns from the lambda and not the main function.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val someLambda:() -> Int = tag@{
        return@tag 1
    }
    println(someLambda())
}
```
### Manipulating local functions
- You can store all these functions in a reference as we've already seen in the examples and then call them.
