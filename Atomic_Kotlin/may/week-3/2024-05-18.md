## Folding lists
- fold() is similar to reduce() operation but unlike reduce you can supply an initial value to the lambda.
- There is also foldRight() which starts from right end of the list and moves to the left side.
```kotlin
fun main(){
    val numbers = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    
    val result = numbers.fold(0) { sum, i ->
        sum + i
    }
    
    val result2 = numbers.foldRight(0) { sum, i ->
        sum + i
    }
}
```
- You can also get the value at each stage in fold() or reduce() by using runningFold() or runningReduce().
- This will return a list of value at each stage in fold or reduce.
```kotlin
fun main(){
    val numbers = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    
    val listOfVals = numbers.runninFold(0) { sum, i ->
        sum + i
    }
    //[1, 3, 6, 10]
    //Same could be done for runningReduce()
}
```
