## Recursion and Tail recursion
- You know recursion, don't need to explain it here
- Things to keep in mind when using recursion, your recursive function could overflow the stack even if it's not an infinite one and just makes too many calls for the stack to keep.
- To prevent stackoverflow many functional languages use a technique called tail recursion.
- In kotlin you use tailrec keyword in front of fun keyword.
- In tail recursion a recursive function is turned into an iterative one. This happens at compiler level.
- There's one condition to use tail recursion; recursion must be the final operation of your function, i.e no extra calculations at the end on result of function call, only the function call.
- You have to design your recursive function to satisfy this condition.
- I understand all this theory, but I need some time to make an example out of this as it's very confusing when doing it actually.
