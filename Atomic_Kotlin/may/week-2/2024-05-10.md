# Notes from 2024-05-10
## Sequences
- Also known as streams in other functional languages. 
- With sequences, you can perform operations in a lazy evaluation style: a result is computed when you need it. Also called as vertical evaluation
- Convert list to a sequence using asSequence() method.
```kotlin
@Test
fun testSequence() {
    val numbers = List(10) { it + 1}
    val sequenceToList = numbers.asSequence()
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it } // only executes when number is even otherwise not executed
        .toList()
    assertEquals(listOf(4,16,36,64,100), sequenceToList)
}
```
- Two categories of sequence operations
  - Intermediate - returns a sequence ex. filter() and map() 
  - Terminal - returns non-sequence ex. toList()
- You can generate new infinite sequences using following syntax
```kotlin
val sequence = generateSequence(seedValue) { it + incrementValue }
```
- You can take a finite amount of information from them using take() and takeIf() operation.
```kotlin
@Test
fun testTake() {
    val sequence = generateSequence(0) { it+1 }
    assertEquals(listOf(0,1,2,3,4), sequence.take(5).toList())
}

@Test
fun testTakeIf() {
    val list = List(10) { it + 1}
    val sequence = generateSequence {
        list.removeFirst().takeIf { it != 5 }
    }
    assertEquals(listOf(1,2,3,4), sequence.toList())
}
```
- You can only iterate through a sequence once.
