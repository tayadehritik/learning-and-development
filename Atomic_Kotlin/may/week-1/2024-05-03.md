# Notes from 2024-05-03
## Operations on collections
- We are provided a lot of operations that can be performed on collections through lambdas.
- You can see the book to learn about all the operations, I'll list some mentioned first in the book.
```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    @Test
    fun testFilter() {
        assertEquals(numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }, listOf(2,4))
    }
    @Test
    fun testAny() {
        //check if there's any even number in list
        assertEquals(numbers.any { it % 2 == 0}, true)
    }

    @Test
    fun testAll() {
        //check if all are even number in list
        assertEquals(numbers.all { it % 2 == 0 }, false)
    }

    @Test
    fun testNone() {
        //check if none of the numbers are less than zero
        assertEquals(numbers.none { it < 0 }, true)
    }

    @Test
    fun testCount() {
        //check the number of even numbers in list
        assertEquals(numbers.count { it % 2 == 0 }, 2)
    }
```
