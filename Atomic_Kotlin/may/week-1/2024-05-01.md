# Notes from 2024-05-01
## Importance of lambdas
- Lambdas help us write a short amount of code which is already tested in some sense.
- Like when you use a filter lambda you only need to write the logic to filter and not the other parts, where something could go wrong.
```kotlin
@Test
fun testMain() {
    val list = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    val filteredList = list.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    assertEquals(listOf(2,4), filteredList)
}
```
- Just like ordinary functions you could read/modify variable of the parent scope.
```kotlin
@Test
fun testMain() {
    var sum = 0
    val list = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    var result = list.forEach { sum += it }
    assertEquals(10,sum)
}
```
