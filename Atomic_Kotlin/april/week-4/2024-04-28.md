## Star projection
- Star projection is very similar to "Any"
- With the use of star projection you need check for type safety unlike with "Any" where you don't need to check for it.
- In a structure with star projection you cannot add to it, because you don't know the type of it.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    var list:List<*> = mutableListOf("hello",1, 1.23)
    var list2:List<Any> = mutableListOf("hello",1,1.23)
    println(list[2]?.javaClass) // need to check for null, because star projection
    println(list2[2].javaClass)
    list.addLast(1) // does not work, shows error in the editor
    list2.addLast(1) // works
}
```
