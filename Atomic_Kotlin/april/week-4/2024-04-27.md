## Generics
- Generic classes are used when we need to define a class where the parameters to the class could be of several types.
- "Any" could be used in the same way but since "Any" does not know what kind of object it is, it cannot access the properties or methods of the object.
- Generic functions could also be defined by adding \<T> in front of the functionName
- There is also "*" - called star projection which can also be used as generics, but it still not clear to me. Would investigate more about this tomorrow.
```kotlin
class CustomType {
    fun printMe(){
        println("Hello world")
    }
}

class GenericClassName <T> (var param:T) {
    fun returnParam(): T {
        return param
    }
}

class AnyClassName (var param:Any) {
    fun returnParam(): Any {
        return param
    }
}

fun <T> genericFunctionName(param:T) {
    fun returnParam(): T{
        return param
    }
}

fun main() {
    var genericClass = GenericClassName<CustomType>(CustomType())
    var genericParam = genericClass.returnParam()
    var anyClass = AnyClassName(CustomType())
    var anyParam = anyClass.returnParam()
    genericParam.printMe() // works, because type is known here
    anyParam.printMe() // gives error, because any does not know what kind of class is here

    var genericFunctionCall = genericFunctionName(1)
    var genericFunctionCall2 = genericFunctionName("String")
    println(genericFunctionCall)
    println(genericFunctionCall2)
}
```
## Extension Properties
- Just like functions you can also extend properties of a type.
- Syntax - need to use a getter
```kotlin
val someType.newProperty: propertyType
    get() = someValue
```
- Example
```kotlin
val String.someNewProperty: Int
    get() = 1

fun main() {
    println("sdfa".someNewProperty)
}
```
