# Notes from 2024-04-26
## Non-Null Assertions !!
- Non-Null assertions were introduced in Kotlin for interoperability with Java. These should be avoided at all costs.
- It says that I know the variable is not null, go ahead.

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var abc:String? = "1"
    println(abc!!.toInt())
    abc = null
    try {

        println(abc!!.toInt())
    }
    catch(e:Exception) {
        println(e)
    }
}
```
## Extension function for Nullable Types
- You can call these functions even without ? safe call, Because these functions are defined on Nullable types.
```kotlin
fun String?.extensionFunction(): Unit {
    
}

fun String.extensionFunctionNonNullable(): Unit {
    
}

fun main() {
    var abc:String? = "abc"
    println(abc.extensionFunction()) // does not require safe callback because the function declaration handles it
    println(abc?.extensionFunctionNonNullable()) // requires safe callback because function declaration does not handle it
}
```
