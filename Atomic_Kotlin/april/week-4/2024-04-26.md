## Non-Null Assertions !!
- Non-Null assertions were introduced in Kotlin for interoperability with Java. These should be avoided at all costs.
- It says that I know the variable is not null, go ahead.

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var abc:String? = "1"
    println(abc!!.toInt())
    abc = null
    try {

        println(abc!!.toInt())
    }
    catch(e:Exception) {
        println(e)
    }
}
```
