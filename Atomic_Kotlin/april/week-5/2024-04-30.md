## Functional Programming
### Lambdas
- Lambdas represent a short and concise piece of code.
- Within a lambda there could be multiple expressions, but it should be written in a way that lambda returns only one value.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    var list = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    println(list.map({ param ->
        if (param % 2 == 0) {
            param.toFloat().toString()
        } else {
            param.toString()
        }

    }))
    /* [1, 2.0, 3, 4.0] */
}
```
- When lambda takes a single argument, kotlin names it as "it" by default, so you don't need to list it in params.
- If a function takes only a lambda as a parameter you could drop () braces and write lambda directly with {}
- If a function takes lambda at last argument you could drop the () braces there as well
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val list = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    list.map {
        it.toString()
    }
}
```
- A lambda can take multiple arguments as well and if you want to ignore an argument you could use _ 
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val list = listOf(1,2,3,4)
    list.mapIndexed { _, value -> 
        value.toString()
    }
}
```
