# Notes from 2024-04-29
## break, continue
- Already knew break and continue but this book compares them with goto statements,
never thought about it in that way, but it makes sense.
- continue jumps to the start of the loop.
- break jumps to the end of the loop.
```kotlin
fun main() {
    //continue jumps here
    for(i in 0..10) {
        if(i % 2 == 0) continue
        if(i == 7) break
        println(i)
    }
    //break jumps here
}
```
## labels
- Always wanted to learn this but never had an opportunity
- You can assign labels to looped constructs and break or continue referencing those labels.
- Syntax: labelname@ loop_construct {}
```kotlin
fun main() {
    //continue jumps here
    outer@ for(i in 0..10) {
        inner@ for(j in 'a' .. 'z') {
            if(j == 'b') continue@outer
            if(i == 7) break@outer
            println("$i$j")
        }
    }
    //break jumps here

     */
}
```
